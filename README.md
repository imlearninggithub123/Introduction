- This is actually my second GitHub account. My main account is https://github.com/uservinhsoislearning. I mainly upload low-level programming exercises here.
- I want to work in data-related fields in the future.
- I’m a third year college student at HUST.
- You can contact me via my personal email on my profile.
- I have contributed in a few projects, however, if you go to my GitHub account (both), you will notice that there are no contributions! Because I did not know how to use GitHub back then. So my work are uploaded on my personal Kaggle (link on my main acc)
